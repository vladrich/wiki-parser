/**
 * <p>
 * Represents one entry in an Access Control List (ACL).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL entry objects.
 * Each ACL entry object contains a set of positive page permissions associated
 * with a particular principal. (A principal represents an entity such as an
 * individual user, group, or role). Each principal can have at most one ACL
 * entry; that is, multiple ACL entries are not allowed for any principal.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is functionally equivalent to the java.security.acl.AclEntry
 * interface, minus negative permissions.
