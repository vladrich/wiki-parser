Use '+' to require a word, '-' to forbid a word.  For example:

{{{
          +java -emacs jsp
}}}

finds pages that MUST include the word "java", and MAY NOT include
the word "emacs".  Also, pages that contain the word "jsp" are
ranked before the pages that don't.

All searches are case insensitive.  If a page contains both
forbidden and required keywords, it is not shown.
